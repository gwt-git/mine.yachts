Ungher,"A heavy version of the Raubtier assault frigate, an icon of the Regicide military machine and one of the symbols of the fall of the Synod in the Metropole. The platform is well-protected, equipped with a powerful metabolic system, and decent weapon systems. Being quite large for its class, Ungher can compete with much heavier ships. Due to high technology and focused enhancements, the platform lacks some fairly basic systems if used outside of military operations.

Microptero,"A frigate platform. The Microptero is an exceptionally lightweight platform built for Petrichor Prospect. It is one of the lightest ships in the frigate class and received numerous upgrades during years of extensive use including advanced stabilizers and a highly efficient fueling system. Intended for surveying, scouting and prospecting in hostile territory, the platform can be optimized for combat or reconnaissance. Oath, Far Reach and Visceral each deployed the Microptero as an electronic warfare interceptor and while various nefarious groups made use of its stealth profile and extreme speed.

Val,"A hauling frigate platform. The Val was frequently employed by GSC and Petrichor because of its ability to stand up to both the brutal environment and the hostile population. A small, agile freighter design with adequate combat and navigation support, it was a core component of armed cargo convoys featuring heavier combat platforms such as the Dremar or the Caruda. The VAL platform is durable enough for extended journeys in a variety of harsh conditions.

Harpia,"A mobile destroyer platform. The Harpia features the high-resolution sensor systems equipped on all Petrichor ships. This model excels in both combat reconnaissance and assault operations, having been adapted for hunting large targets with multiple weapon systems. A primary military product for Petrichor, the Harpia provided significant offensive and defensive support around resource extraction sites.

Strix,"A destroyer platform. The Strix is a stealthy and durable hybrid destroyer platform that can be optimized for combat or recon missions.

Baile,"A platform for an assault cruiser. In the Regicide doctrine, ships of this type typically supported assault groups consisting of Unghers and Raubtier. Baile's large holds, combined with a robust strike base, make it a formidable cruiser for broad application. Instead of pneumatic bomb launchers, these ships were often equipped with a pneumatic supply system, for delivering goods to allies or to create a burden on the enemy's defense system with traps.

Flegel,"A cargo cruiser platform. The Flegel accommodates decent combat equipment for its class and features a unique rotary propulsion system for effective maneuvering and mass transfer. The upper fuselage was designed with a robust wing-like structure allowing continued operation even under heavy fire to prevent the enemy from disrupting trade routes with small forces.

Axte,"A battlecruiser platform. The Axte was developed by Kyrisser specifically for Regicide’s more aggressive operations on the Frontier. This ship was a commerce-disrupting predator used extensively against the Synod and the Clans, though indiscriminate Axte deployment around crude extraction sites led to accusations piracy and claim jumping by other Venture corporations. Despite being more optimal for hunting than entrenched engagement, the combat qualities of the model make it a highly unattractive target for most assault groups.
